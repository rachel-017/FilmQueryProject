# Film Query Project

The Film Query Project was created to demonstrate how SQL can be used in Java. Within this project, the FilmQueryApp class can access a simulated video store's database to find information on a film by executing a query prompted by the user.

## Usage

The FilmQueryApp class is used to access all features of the program. When the class is run, the user is prompted to select from a menu. Option 1 allows the user to search for a film using the film ID. Option 2 searches for films using a keyword. Lastly, option 3 lets the user exit from the program. Option one, returns one specific film that matches that films exact ID, unless no film with that ID exists within the database. Option 2, however, will return any film where the keyword is mention in either the title or the description of the film.

## Technologies Used

- SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Looping
- Exceptions
- Maven

## Lessons Learned

During this project I learned how SQL can be used as a tool in Java for searching databases. I also learned how to prepare Java to use SQL by using Maven Dependencies.
